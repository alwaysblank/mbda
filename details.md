## Who should apply?

In general, the Initiative is intended to provide assistance to minority groups/individuals without the resources to hire a web developer. That includes, but is not limited to:

- Women
- People of color
- Queer-identified people

If you're unsure, feel free to apply.

## What do you need to apply?

The application form will also prompt you to add these things, but you'll want to have the following prepared:

1. Your name
2. Who you (or your oganization) are/is, what you do, and why you need a website
3. A timeframe (i.e., you need a site by the 2018 election cycle; you need a site by spring 2017, etc)
4. What you want your site to do
5. Your favorite movies/TV shows/books/comics
6. A link to your existing site (if you have one)

## How are applicants considered?

The ultimate decision is up to the board of the Initiative (whch is, currently, just myself). Although many things will be taken into consideration, some of them are as follows:

- Degree of need (both financial and social)
- Likelyhood that a web site will meaningfuly contribute to the advancement of you and/or your cause/organization
- Purpose of web site
