## What is this?

The Martinez-Bateman Development Initiative is an attempt to put my skills to use helping others, specifically minority groups and individuals.

My name is Ben Martinez-Bateman, and I've been building web sites in a professional capacity for more than 5 years. I work for [Murmur Creative](http://murmurcreatve.com), a full-service creative agency in Portland, OR. 

## How does this work?

During each round, I'll select an applicant. That applicant could be you! If it is, I'll develop a site for you, or the organization you represent. Once the site is finished, I'll help you find and set up hosting, train you in the site's use (if applicable), launch your site, and provide some support after launch. 

## What kind of site are we talking about?

That's up to you! But some examples might be:

- Political candidate (at any level)
- Ballot measure/local ordinance/etc
- Advocacy organization

Generally, the kind of site we'll be building is relatively simple, with a few pages, some contact forms, and perhaps a blog. 

## How can I get involved?

If you'd like to apply, head on over to the [Apply](/apply) page, and fill out the form. If you're selected, you'll be notified via email.

If you're interested in helping out with development (or design), feel free to [email me](mailto:ben+mbdi@alwaysblank.org).
